This project is a bare-bones VM coded in C that I am making because I want to get into low-level computing and cybersecurity. I am using the LC-3 (Little Computer 3) architecture as it is a simplified architecture made primarily for educational purposes. 

The LC-3 has 65,536 memory locations, each storing a 16-bit value, and 10 16-bit registers.
